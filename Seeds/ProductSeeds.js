The J720 is factory calibrated to launch 1mW (0dBm) into fiber when driven by a +5 volt, 50-ohm source. Note that a 5 volt, 50-ohm source produces 2.5 volts into a 50-ohm load. The 50-ohm source impedance sets operating current, and absorbs signal reflections between the source, cable and J720."],

The J720 can operate with a +3.3V, 50-ohm source provided that the J720's sensitivity trimpot is adjusted to compensate for the lower signal level. Access the trimpot by removing the round silver sticker on the top of the enclosure. Use a small flat head screwdriver to carefully rotate the trimpot clockwise while observing optical power level with the calibrated monitor port of a Highland optical-to-electrical converter, or separate power meter. Rotate trimpot fully clockwise if adjusting a 1310nm version."],

          ["What is the difference between the P400 and the P500?", "The Highland Model P500 Digital Delay/Pulse Generator is the successor of Model P400. We typically recommend purchasing the P500 over the P400 because it is less expensive, it has an improved user interface, and it will be supported for a very long time. The P400 design is over 10 years old and is being gradually phased out of our product offerings due to component obsolescence challenges. Some new features of the P500 include: improved packaging, color LCD, quiet fan, streamlined design, standard USB, Ethernet, and RS232, high performance pulse output stages with clean fast pulses from 0.5 to 25 volts p-p into 50 ohms, rep-rate to 14 MHz, glitch-free timing changes, and optional per-shot timing lists and multiple pulses per trigger."], 
          ["Can the P500 firmware be field upgraded?", "Yes, the P500 firmware can be field upgraded. The firmware is most easily upgraded by connecting to the P500 through a web browser, following the link for AUX, and pulling down the firmware tab. From there you can either use the Choose File button or drag and drop the provided .tar file onto the box where it says No file chosen. Then hit Submit and it will update the unit. Contact sales for a copy of the latest .tar firmware that is compatible with your hardware revision."],

The T165 includes a 3-pin male header that has one of its pins connect to pin 14 on the butterfly.

The T165 has a built-in ‘one shot’, enabling the formation of adjustable output current pulses when fed an arbitrarily wide input trigger. Both are AC-coupled, and have duty limits. The T160 is better suited for applications requiring pulse widths beyond hundreds of nanoseconds. Both T160 and T165 utilize the same switched current sink output topology, as shown in the block diagrams, with similar switching dynamics. Both require that drive path inductance remain very low for fast falling edges."],

            "The T560 series is a family of small digital delay generators, intended for use in embedded OEM applications.",
            "The T564 extends the capabilities of Highland's original T560 digital delay generator, allowing not only a single delay program, but a scenario of more than 8000 frames to be preloaded and then executed in rapid succession. Frames can be advanced automatically as triggers are received or simply stored and recalled manually. Each trigger generates four precise pulse outputs, independently programmable with 10 picosecond resolution in both delay and width. The T564 can generate single pulses per trigger as a standard digital delay generator or, new to the T560 DDG family, pulse trains. The Queue function allows new timing settings to be installed without disturbing ongoing cycles or missing triggers.",
            "With the same low 20 nanosecond insertion delay and 20 picosecond jitter as the T560, the T564 is ideal for timing and gating lasers, Q-switches, ICCDs, and other electro-optical devices, and for applying picosecond-resolution time trims to nuclear, radar, and sonar cabling and instrumentation. Additionally, the scenario capability allows moving target simulation in radar/sonar/lidar applications and sliding timing windows for margin testing - all with a form factor smaller than a paperback, with easy RS-232 or optional Ethernet control.",

        "The V410 is a 6U VME module that provides sixteen independent analog inputs that may be used to read RTDs, thermistors, and other similar resistive sensors. It can also read cryogenic diodes. Users may set input range and adjust other settings at VMEbus speed, and depending on the range selected the microprocessor will do the necessary calculations and output voltage, resistance, or temperature. Temperature conversion is available for 100Ω and 1000Ω, series 385 and 392, platinum RTDs.",
        "The V410 works by applying a current to the sensor and measuring the voltage across it. It has four current settings which allows it to accurately read resistance from tens of ohms up to 3MΩ. A look-up table with interpolation allows it to convert resistance to temperature.",
        "Two front-panel 50-pin SCSI connectors interface to external sensors. Each connector provides 8 4-wire inputs, which may also be used as 3-wire or 2-wire connections using external jumpers. A D9 connector provides in-crate calibration check. Each channel incorporates a software controlled DPDT relay that allows the channel output to be diverted to the test connector.",
        "A built-in-self-test (BIST) subsystem adds additional switching, onboard test resistors, a voltage reference, and firmware that allows the invocation of a full closed-loop test of all ranges of all 16 channels. Another BIST subsystem runs continuously and checks for open connections on the SCSI input."
