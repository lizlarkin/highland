        ["Do you sell laser diodes?", "We do not sell or manufacture laser diodes; rather, we build the driver and leave it up to the application to determine the laser. Photodigm is the recommended laser vendor for customers looking for fast, gain-switched impulses."],
        ["Can you recommend a laser to use with your laser drivers?", "The T165 can drive laser diodes with forward voltages up to 3V and laser drive currents up to 700mA. We've done some gain switched experiments with Photodigm 1064 DBR butterfly lasers, and do recommend Photodigm as a laser vendor for customers looking for fast, gain-switched impulses. Beyond Photodigm, we have no had an opportunity to evaluate other laser manufacturers, but are open to do further evaluation if the laser can be provided to Highland for testing."],
        ["Is the T165 available with a temperature controller option?", "The T165 does not include an onboard temperature controller option; however, provisions are made to allow for connecting one. The T165 is very high-speed, so the interface requires that the laser be physically close to avoid anomalies due to circuit parasitics. The T165 is designed to interface with one side of a butterfly laser, pins 8 - 14; Typically, the TEC '-' connection is made at pin 14. The T165 includes a 3-pin male header that has one of its pins connect to pin 14 on the butterfly. The TEC '+' connection for a typical butterfly is on Pin 1 (the side that is not connected at all to the T165), so it would be directly connected to the TEC controller."],
        ["Do I need a cooling device for the T165 laser pulser?", "A fan or other cooling device is not necessary for the evaluation kit versions. It comes with an aluminum baseplate that should keep the T165 at a safe operating temperature in a standard lab environment."],
        ["What is the range of the pulse repetition rate for the T165?", "While the T165 drive current can be set as high as 700 mA, the average current is not to exceed 50 mA, constrained by an absolute maximum 40% duty cycle limit. Table 3 in the T165 technical manual correlates maximum pulse repetition rate (PRR) as a function of laser drive current and width."],
        ["What is the pulse width range of the T165?", "Depending on the version, the effective electrical pulse width range is 0 to 2.5ns for the T165-9, and 0 to 850ns for the T165-13 or T165-15. Narrow width pulses are best handled by the T165-9, as the 850ns wide-range versions trade resolution for span."],
        ["What is the difference between the T160 and T165?", "Both the T160 and T165 require an external trigger source; however, the T160 is a logic follower that routes current to the laser for the duration of the input source. The T165 has a built-in ‘one shot’, enabling the formation of adjustable output current pulses when fed an arbitrarily wide input trigger. Both are AC-coupled, and have duty limits. The T160 is better suited for applications requiring pulse widths beyond hundreds of nanoseconds. Both T160 and T165 utilize the same switched current sink output topology, as shown in the block diagrams, with similar switching dynamics. Both require that drive path inductance remain very low for fast falling edges."],

Frames can be advanced automatically as triggers are received or simply stored and recalled manually. Each trigger generates four precise pulse outputs, independently programmable with 10 picosecond resolution in both delay and width. The T564 can generate single pulses per trigger as a standard digital delay generator or, new to the T560 DDG family, pulse trains. The Queue function allows new timing settings to be installed without disturbing ongoing cycles or missing triggers.",

Additionally, the scenario capability allows moving target simulation in radar/sonar/lidar applications and sliding timing windows for margin testing - all with a form factor smaller than a paperback, with easy RS-232 or optional Ethernet control.",
